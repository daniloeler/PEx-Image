# PEx-Image
Projection Explorer for Images (PEx-Image)

Multidimensional  Visualization  techniques  are invaluable tools for analysis of structured and unstructured data  with  variable  dimensionality. Projection Explorer for Images (PEx-Image) is a tool aimed at supporting analysis of image collections. The tool supports a methodology that employs interactive visualizations to aid user-driven feature detection and classification tasks, thus offering improved analysis and exploration capabilities. The visual mappings employ similarity-based multidimensional projections and point placement to layout the data on a plane for visual exploration. The interaction mechanisms of PEx-Image is focused on image datasets.
