# Brodatz
This folder contains a subset of the classical texture of Brodtaz dataset with features vectores extracted from the image dataset.

No feature space is normalized

BrodatzBoas.zip contains the image dataset

BrodatzPexImage.data is a feature space computed from the image dataset with PEx-Image features (see the paper for more details)

BrodatzPexImage.dmat is a distance matrix computed from the BrodatzPexImage features

gaborBrodatzBoas_NotNormalized.data is a feature space computed with Gabor Features

gaborBrodatzBoaPExImage_NotNormalized.data is a feture space constructed from the combinatior of Gabor and PEx-Image features
